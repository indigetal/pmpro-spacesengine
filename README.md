## Paid Memberships Pro - SpacesEngine Integration

A WordPress plugin that integrates the Paid Memberships Pro plugin with the SpacesEngine plugin for BuddyBoss, enabling monetization and controls for managing memberships and SpacesEngine features.

### Features

**1. Assign PMPro Level Group:**

- Assign a PMPro level group to SpacesEngine memberships in Memberships > SpacesEngine Addon.

**2. Manage SpacesEngine Features:**

- Enable/disable different SpacesEngine features for each PMPro membership level in the assigned PMPro level group.

**3. Restrict Access and Redirect:**

- Restrict access to the “Create New Space” page and define a custom redirect URL.

**4. Define Listing Costs:**

- Define the cost of featured and promoted listings for both monthly and annual subscriptions.

**5. Dynamic Membership Costs:**

- Enable users to upgrade to a featured or promoted listing during the PMPro checkout process and dynamically adjust the membership costs based on user-selected options.

**6. Configure Default Listings:**

- Configure default listings to pre-populate the directory without requiring a plan (must assign a non-admin user account).

**7. Handle Membership Cancellations:**
